* Refer to Penrose Graphical Notation, String Diagrams, Quantum Circuits, MBQC
* Include some applications in lead (MQBC and lattice surgery)
* Soundness and completeness not in introduction
* Ignore scalars
* Right left-to-right. Don't pick an orientation!
* Formulate rigourousness in lead, not emphasize it too much though
* Include Clifford-rules, but maybe not all rules for completeness?
* Include extended Euler Decomposition rule in Completeness Section
* Examples:
      - Circuit to GHZ -- Introduce Colour Change, Spider Fusion, Identity Removal
      - Magic state injection (use $a\pi$ to denote measurement-outcome) -- Introduce Pi-Copy
      - 3 CNOTs is a SWAP, by strong-complementarity -- Introduce Strong Complementarity
