# ZX-calculus

The **ZX-calculus** is a *graphical language* for reasoning about linear maps between *qubits*. The calculus consists of a set of generators from which diagrams can be made, and a set of rules that govern how diagrams can be transformed into one another. The ZX-calculus is *universal* in the sense that any linear map between qubits can be represented as a ZX-diagram. The standard set of rewrite rules for the ZX-calculus is *complete* for the *stabilizer fragment*, meaning that if two ZX-diagrams represent the same stabilizer computation, then each diagram can be rewritten into the other by application of the rules. There exist extensions to this rule-set that make the ZX-calculus complete for all linear maps between qubits.
